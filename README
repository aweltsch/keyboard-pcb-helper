Tool to create pcbs from keyboard layout editor configurations.
First create netlist for given microcontroller and switch footprint.
-> need to define usable pins on microcontroller
Only simple configurations are supported
Placement of microcontroller and wiring TBD.

link keyboard parts
ln -s <path-to-parts.pretty> parts.pretty

Unfortunately, pcbnew is still python2 only, there seems to be some development in kicad to support python3.
libraries
skidl
scipy

Generate netlist from layout
Import netlist into kicad
Place components (script, then manual adjustments)
Add edge cuts
Wiring
Generate gerbers

WANT:
    - Add additional usb port
    - onboard microcontroller
    - stabilizer support
