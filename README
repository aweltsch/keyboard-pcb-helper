Tool to create pcbs from keyboard layout editor configurations.
First create netlist for given microcontroller and switch footprint.
-> need to define usable pins on microcontroller
Only simple configurations are supported
Placement of microcontroller and wiring TBD.

link keyboard component libraries
ln -s <path-to-components-library> components

link keyboard parts
ln -s <path-to-parts.pretty> parts.pretty

Unfortunately, pcbnew is still python2 only, there seems to be some development in kicad to support python3.
libraries
skidl
scipy

There are several scripts for different phases in the pcb design
1. Import KLE layout and transfer into easily readable layout format with explicit coordinates for each key.
   Assign each key to a row and column (TODO for nontrivial cases!, also minimize rows + cols to minimize pins)
   Export layout to json -> see dto format specification
2. Generate schematic & netlist from layout. TODO: Add support for other components, split keyboards, leds, etc.
3. Generate PCB and place keyswitches & diodes according to layout.
4. Manual placement of additional components (microcontroller etc.)
5. Routing (maybe autorouting with additional steps, rows & columns should be easy to "pre-route")
6. Edge cuts and export component placement to json format (?)
7. Generate case files (openscad 3D & 2D)

Guideline: Optimize for common case. Special cases will have to be handled manually anyway.
In particular schematic & switch placement are important to be automated.

WANT:
    - Add additional usb port
    - onboard microcontroller
    - stabilizer support -> via components!
    - bluetooth
